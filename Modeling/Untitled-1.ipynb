Need for developing case deﬁnitions and guidelines for data\\ncollection, analysis, and presentation for low birth weight as an\\nadverse event following maternal immunization\\nThe birth weight of an infant is the ﬁrst weight recorded after\\nbirth, ideally measured within the ﬁrst hours after birth, before\\nsigniﬁcant postnatal weight loss has occurred. Low birth weight\\n(LBW) is deﬁned as a birth weight of less than 2500 g (up to\\nand including 2499 g), as per the World Health Organization\\n(WHO) [1]. This deﬁnition of LBW has been in existence for many\\ndecades. In 1976, the 29th World Health Assembly agreed on the\\ncurrently used deﬁnition. Prior to this, the deﬁnition of LBW was\\n‘2500 g or less’. Low birth weight is further categorized into very\\nlow birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) and extremely low birth\\nweight (ELBW, <1000 g)[1]. Low birth weight is a result of pre-\\nterm birth (PTB, short gestation <37 completed weeks), intrauter-\\nine growth restriction (IUGR, also known as fetal growth\\nrestriction), or both.\\nThe term low birth weight refers to an absolute weight of <2500 g\\nregardless of gestational age. Small for gestational age (SGA) refers to\\nnewborns whose birth weight is less than the 10th percentile for ges-\\ntational age. This report will focus speciﬁcally on birth weight\\n<2500 g. Further details related to case deﬁnitions for PTB[2], IUGR\\nand SGA are included in separate GAIA reports.\\nGlobally, it is estimated that 15–20% of all births, or >20 million\\nnewborns annually, are low birth weight infants. Low- and middle-\\nincome countries account for a disproportionate burden of LBW;\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.049\\n0264-410X//C2112017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\\nThis is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\\n⇑ Corresponding author at: Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal\\nPathogens Research Unit, Johannesburg, South Africa.\\nE-mail address: contact@brightoncollaboration.org (C.L.

There are\\nmarked global and regional variations in LBW rates. An estimated\\n6% of infants are born LBW in East Asia and the Paciﬁc, 13% in\\nSub-Saharan Africa, and up to 28% in South Asia[3]. Up to half of\\nall LBW infants are born in south Asia[4]. High-income regions\\nreport lower LBW rates, including 6.9% from UK[5]. Of concern is\\nthe estimated increase in LBW rates in certain middle-income\\ncountries such as Oman, where the LBW rate went from 4% in\\n1980 to 8.1% in 2000[6].\\nOne of the major challenges in monitoring the incidence of LBW\\nis that more than half of infants in the LMICs are not weighed[7].\\nPopulation-based survey data often rely on modeled estimates,\\nwith statistical methods to adjust for underreporting and misre-\\nporting of birth weight. In the context of vaccine safety monitoring,\\naccurate ascertainment of birth weight in LMICs will continue to\\nrequire attention and investment to improve accuracy and report-\\ning of this important health indicator.\\n1.1.1. Why are we concerned about low birth weight?\\nLow birth weight is a valuable public health indicator of mater-\\nnal health, nutrition, healthcare delivery, and poverty. Neonates\\nwith low birth weight have a >20 times greater risk of dying than\\nneonates with birth weight of >2500 g[8,9]. Additionally, low birth\\nweight is associated with long-term neurologic disability, impaired\\nlanguage development[10], impaired academic achievement, and\\nincreased risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease\\nand diabetes. Preterm infants carry additional risk due to immatu-\\nrity of multiple organ systems, including intracranial hemorrhage,\\nrespiratory distress, sepsis, blindness, and gastrointestinal disor-\\nders. Preterm birth is the leading cause of all under-5 child mortal-\\nity worldwide[11].\\nIn addition, economic studies in low-income settings have\\ndemonstrated that reducing the burden of low birth weight would\\nhave important cost savings both to the health system and to\\nhouseholds [12].\\n1.1.2. What leads to low birth weight?\\nThe underlying causes of both PTB and IUGR are multifactorial,\\nand the biological pathways and preventive strategies for these\\ntwo conditions are quite different [13–15]. The exact cause of\\nPTB may be unknown in many cases, however numerous maternal,\\nfetal and placental factors may contribute to PTB[13]. Signiﬁcant\\nmaternal conditions include extra-uterine infection, chorioam-\\nnionitis, trauma and illness (e.g. pre-eclampsia/eclampsia). Signif-\\nicant fetal conditions include IUGR, fetal infection, death and\\nanomalies. Placental pathologic conditions include placental\\nabruption and placenta praevia[13].\\nIn general, the causes of IUGR can be due to maternal, fetal, and\\nplacental factors. Although the etiologies are different, they often\\nhave the ﬁnal common pathway of insufﬁcient uterine-placental\\nperfusion and fetal nutrition.\\nIUGR can be asymmetrical IUGR (where babies have features of\\nmalnutrition), symmetrical IUGR (hypoplastic small for dates) or\\nmixed IUGR. Asymmetrical IUGR is the most common (70–80%)\\nform of IUGR, resulting from an insult (often utero-placental insuf-\\nﬁciency) later in pregnancy, which results in affected babies having\\nnormal length and head circumference (brain sparing), but reduced\\nweight. Symmetrical IUGR on the other hand arises from an insult\\n(often genetic, structural or infectious) occurring earlier in preg-\\nnancy leading to a reduction in all anthropometric parameters in\\nfetus/newborn [15].\\nInsufﬁcient perfusion, through abnormal placentation, aberrant\\nplacental vascularization, maternal hypertensive disorders, and\\ntobacco use, all result in IUGR. Multiple gestation (i.e., twins, tri-\\nplets) is associated with increased risk of both IUGR and PTB\\n[16]. Infectious diseases, including intrauterine infections, HIV,\\nand malaria, result in LBW due to both growth restriction and short\\ngestation. Multiple maternal characteristics, risk behaviors, and\\nsocial determinants are associated with both IUGR and PTB; these\\ninclude maternal short stature, maternal malnutrition, low body\\nmass index, poverty, black race, narrow child spacing, low mater-\\nnal education, poor antenatal care, substance abuse, and emotional\\nand physical stress[5,17–19]. How these factors are mediated bio-\\nlogically remains poorly understood.\\nPreterm birth may be spontaneous or medically-indicated, such\\nas induction or cesarean section for maternal complications such\\nas pre-eclampsia. Infectious and inﬂammatory processes are asso-\\nciated with increased risk for PTB, including chorioamnionitis, bac-\\nterial vaginosis, bacteriuria, and systemic or remote site infection\\nsuch as sepsis and periodontal disease.\\n1.1.3. The importance of short gestation on immune function and\\nvaccine efﬁcacy\\nTransplacental antibody transfer is an active process mediated\\nby Fc receptors in the placental syncytiotrophoblast[20], which\\nincreases from 30 weeks gestation. Small molecular weight parti-\\ncles (<600 Da) cross the placenta by passive mechanism including\\ndiffusion, however, larger molecular weight particles (>1000 Da)\\nare transported across the placenta by and active receptor-medi-\\nated process[21]. Fetal IgG levels are approximately 50% of mater-\\nnal antibody level at 32 weeks gestation and rises rapidly through\\nthe third trimester [22]. Preterm newborns have signiﬁcantly\\nlower antibody levels than term newborns[22]. LBW term new-\\nborns have signiﬁcantly lower antibody concentrations to Herpes\\nsimplex virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus ad varicella zoster\\nvirus than term newborns with birth weight >2500 g[23].\\nMaternal antibody levels, receptor density and functionality,\\navidity, antigen nature, and gestational age determine the efﬁ-\\nciency of placental antibody transfer[24]. Diseases that are highly\\nprevalent in some areas, such as malaria and human immunodeﬁ-\\nciency virus (HIV), are known to cause placental damage, especially\\nplacental malaria[25,26]. Maternal HIV infection has been consis-\\ntently associated with reduced placental passage of antibodies\\nagainst several common viral and bacterial antigens[27,28]. Pla-\\ncental malaria has been associated with maternal hypergamma-\\nglobulinemia and reduced transfer of antibodies against measles\\nvirus, Clostridium tetani , Streptococcus pneumonia , and varicella-\\nzoster virus in some studies[20,29–31]. The transfer during preg-\\nnancy of maternal antibodies to the fetus minimizes deﬁciencies in\\nantibody production in the fetus and provides short-term passive\\nimmunity [32], conditioning the success of vaccination in new-\\nborns [33] which is especially important in preterm and IUGR new-\\nborns. Multiple comorbidities are associated with both LBW and\\nimmune suppression, such as malnutrition and infection, thereby\\nfurther exacerbating diminished immune function in the compro-\\nmised newborn.\\n1.1.4. Maternal immunization and birth weight\\nMaternal infections, including inﬂuenza, have been associated\\nwith increased risk of low birth weight newborns[34]. As a corol-\\nlary, prevention of certain infections during pregnancy might\\nhave a protective effect against LBW. This has been observed in\\na maternal immunization trial conducted in Bangladesh[35],i n\\nwhich the mean birth weight of infants born to mothers who\\nreceived an inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine during pregnancy was\\nhigher than of infants born to mothers who received a pneumo-\\ncoccal polysaccharide vaccine (3178 g vs. 2978 g, p = 0.02). This\\ntrend has not been observed in other maternal inﬂuenza immu-\\nnization trials [36].\\nC.L. Cutland et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 6492–6500 6493'),\n",

Methods for the review of the case deﬁnition and guidelines for\\ndata collection, analysis, and presentation for low birth weight in\\nclinical trial and population settings\\nFollowing the process described in the overview paper[21] as\\nwell as on the Brighton Collaboration Website http://www.\\nbrightoncollaboration.org/internet/en/index/process.html, the\\nBrighton CollaborationLow birth weight Working Group was formed\\nin 2016 and included 16 members of varied backgrounds including\\nclinical, academic, public health and industry. The composition of\\nthe working and reference group as well as results of the web-based\\nsurvey completed by the reference group with subsequent discus-\\nsions in the working group can be viewed at:http://www.brighton-\\ncollaboration.org/internet/en/index/working_groups.html.\\nTo guide the decision-making for the guidelines, a literature\\nsearch was performed using Medline/PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey\\n(ebooks), ScienceDirect (eBooks), eBrary (eBooks) and the\\nCochrane Libraries, including the terms: ‘pregnancy, vaccines and\\nlow birth weight’, and restricted to English language publications\\nsince 2005. The search resulted in the identiﬁcation of 41 refer-\\nences. All abstracts were screened for possible reports of Low birth\\nweight following immunization. Thirty-two articles with poten-\\ntially relevant material were reviewed in more detail, in order to\\nidentify studies using case deﬁnitions or, in their absence, provid-\\ning clinical descriptions of the case material. This review resulted\\nin a detailed summary of 19 articles, including information on\\nthe study type, the vaccine, the diagnostic criteria or case deﬁni-\\ntion put forth, the time interval since time of immunization, and\\nany other symptoms. Multiple general medical, pediatric and infec-\\ntious disease book chapters were also searched.\\nThe deﬁnition of low birth weight used was consistent across all\\nliterature reviewed.\\nA second literature search using the search terms ‘birth weight\\nand tools’ was performed using Pubmed, to identify other mea-\\nsurements used as proxies for birth weight. The search, unre-\\nstricted for language and year of publication, identiﬁed in 235\\nresults. Titles were screened and 10 articles were identiﬁed for fur-\\nther review.\\n1.3. Rationale for selected decisions about the case deﬁnition of low\\nbirth weight as an adverse event following maternal immunization\\n1.3.1. The term low birth weight\\n‘Low birth weight’ (LBW) has been deﬁned as ﬁrst weight\\nrecorded within hours of birth of <2500 g. Very low birth weight\\n(VLBW) is accepted as <1500 g and extremely low birth weight\\n(ELBW) is <1000 g[1].\\nWithin the deﬁnition context, however, the three diagnostic\\nlevels must not be misunderstood as reﬂecting different grades\\nof clinical severity. They instead reﬂect diagnostic certainty.\\nThe levels of certainty have been formulated such that the Level\\n1 deﬁnition is highly speciﬁc for the condition. Two additional\\ndiagnostic levels have been included in the deﬁnition, offering a\\nstepwise loss of precision and accuracy from Level One down to\\nLevel Three, while retaining an approach to expand utilization of\\navailable data. In this way it is hoped that information on low birth\\nweight can be captured more broadly at the population level.\\n1.3.2. Timing of birth weight assessment\\nThe birth weight is described as the ﬁrst weight measured,\\nhowever, in settings with low rates of facility-based deliveries, a\\nnewborn may not be assessed by a health care worker until several\\ndays old. Birth weight should be assessed within hours of birth,\\nprior to signiﬁcant weight loss[37]. Term neonates lose between\\n3.5% and 6.6% of their birth weight within the ﬁrst 2.5–2.7 days\\nof life. Exclusively breastfed neonates have a greater weight loss\\n(Median 6.6%, 95%CI 6.3–6.9%) than formula-fed (Median 3.5%,\\n95%CI 3.0–3.9%) or mixed fed (5.9%, 95%CI 4.8–6.9%) neonates\\nrespectively, and take longer to regain their birth weight (8.3 vs.\\n6.5 vs. 7.9 days)[37].\\nThe LBW working group decided to restrict ‘birth weight’ to a\\nweight measured in the ﬁrst 48 h of life. In the absence of a weight\\nmeasured within the ﬁrst 48 h of life, a weight measured during\\nthe ﬁrst week of life, could be classiﬁed as an ‘early neonatal\\nweight’ but not ‘birth weight’.\\nIn a clinical trial scenario, measurement of weight within ﬁrst\\n48 h of life should be achievable, as the clinical trial would procure\\nadequate equipment, employ and train staff to assess birth weight\\nin a timely manner, and enroll participants who reside in areas\\nwhich are relatively easily accessed by trial or health care staff.\\nMany newborns globally are not weighed within hours of birth,\\nmainly due to difﬁculty in accessing health care personnel, facili-\\nties, and essential equipment. Speciﬁc time frames for onset of\\nsymptoms following immunization are not included for the follow-\\ning main reasons:\\nWe postulate that a deﬁnition designed to be a suitable tool for\\ntesting causal relationships requires ascertainment of the outcome\\n(e.g. low birth weight) independent from the exposure (e.g. immu-\\nnizations). Therefore, to avoid selection bias, a restrictive time\\ninterval from immunization to birth of a LBW newborn should\\nnot be an integral part of such a deﬁnition. Instead, where feasible,\\ndetails of this interval should be assessed and reported as\\ndescribed in the data collection guidelines.\\nFurther, measurement of birth weight often occurs outside the\\ncontrolled setting of a clinical trial or hospital. In some settings it\\nmay be impossible to obtain a clear timeline of the assessment of\\na birth weight, particularly in less developed or rural settings. In\\norder to avoid selecting against such cases, the Brighton Collabora-\\ntion case deﬁnition avoids setting arbitrary time frames. The time\\nbetween delivery and measurement of birth weight should be\\nrecorded and accounted for in the analysis.\\n6494 C.L. Cutland et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 6492–6500'),\n",

Guidelines for data collection, analysis and presentation\\nAs mentioned in the overview paper[38], the case deﬁnition is\\naccompanied by guidelines which are structured according to the\\nsteps of conducting a clinical trial, i.e. data collection, analysis\\nand presentation. Neither case deﬁnition nor guidelines are\\nintended to guide or establish criteria for management of ill\\ninfants, children, or adults. Both were developed to improve\\nstandardization of case deﬁnitions and data comparability.\\n1.5. Periodic review\\nSimilar to all Brighton Collaboration case deﬁnitions and guide-\\nlines, review of the deﬁnition with its guidelines is planned on a\\nregular basis (i.e. every three to ﬁve years) or more often if needed.\\n2.

The details of time of\\nbirth weight assessment, and details of scale used and calibration\\ndetails are usually not recorded in newborn assessment medical\\nnotes.\\nThe newborn weight assessment is presumed to be assessed\\naccurately as per health care center’s standard operating proce-\\ndures. In many instances, trialists need to rely on the attending\\nmedical staff at health care facility for birth weight assessment.\\nStrengthening training and oversight of birth weight measurement\\nwould be expected to strengthen data both in clinical trials and\\npost-marketing surveillance.\\n2.1. Other tools under investigation to estimate birth weight in\\nindividuals and populations\\nUp to 60 million infants are born at home annually[39], and up\\nto 48% of infants worldwide are not weighed at birth[3]. Lack of\\naccess to health care facilities or health care workers hampers\\naccurate assessment of low birth weight rates in many regions.\\nIn order to identify small newborns, who could be preterm, IUGR,\\nor both, who require additional care, inexpensive tools are required\\nwhich can be utilized in the ﬁeld.\\nThe lack of data available has encouraged the development of a\\nmathematical model to calculate the expected number of adverse\\nevents, including neonatal and maternal deaths, SGA, preterm birth\\nand major congenital malformations[40].\\nSeveral anthropometric measurements, including chest circum-\\nference, foot length and mid-upper arm circumference, have been\\nassessed as proxies for birth weight[41–44]. Table 1 summarizes\\nthese tools and their validity for identifying low birth weight new-\\nborns. These tools at this point are considered investigational and\\nhave been included in level 4 deﬁnition only, which indicates that\\nevidence is inadequate to meet the deﬁnition, however, may be\\nuseful for population background LBW estimates.\\nIn addition to these measurements, other tools are utilized in\\nsome communities to assess birth weight, including difference\\nbetween adult weight with and without newborn in arms (see\\nFig. 1).\\n3. Guidelines for data collection, analysis and presentation of\\nlow birth weight\\nIt was the consensus of the Brighton Collaboration Working\\nGroup for Low birth weight to recommend the following guidelines\\nto enable meaningful and standardized collection, analysis, and\\npresentation of information about low birth weight. However,\\nimplementation of all guidelines might not be possible in all set-\\ntings. The availability and quality of information may vary depend-\\ning upon resources, geographical region, and whether the source of\\ninformation is a prospective clinical trial, epidemiological study,\\npost-marketing surveillance, or an individual report. Also, as\\nexplained in more detail in the overview paper[38], these guideli-\\nnes have been developed by this working group for guidance only,\\nand are not to be considered a mandatory requirement for data col-\\nlection, analysis, or presentation.\\n3.1. Data collection\\nThese guidelines represent a desirable standard for the collection\\nof data on availability following immunization to allow for compara-\\nbility of data, and are recommended as an addition to data collected\\nfor the speciﬁc study question and setting.

Data presentation\\nThese guidelines represent a desirable standard for the presen-\\ntation and publication of data on Low birth weight following\\nimmunization to allow for comparability of data, and are recom-\\nmended as an addition to data presented for the speciﬁc study\\nquestion and setting. Additionally, it is recommended to refer to\\nexisting general guidelines for the presentation and publication\\nof randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-\\nanalyses of observational studies in epidemiology (e.g. statements\\nof Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)[51],o f\\nImproving the quality of reports of meta-analyses of randomized\\ncontrolled trials (QUORUM)[52], and of meta-analysis Of Observa-\\ntional Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)[53], respectively).\\n(31) All reported events of Low birth weight should be presented\\naccording to the categories listed in guideline 31.\\n(32) Data on Low birth weight events should be presented in\\naccordance with data collection guidelines 1–25 and data\\nanalysis guidelines 26–30.\\n(33) Data should be presented as rates with a numerator and\\ndenominator (n/N) (and not only in percentages), with con-\\nﬁdence intervals around the point estimates.\\nAlthough immunization safety surveillance systems denomina-\\ntor data are usually not readily available, attempts should be made\\nto identify approximate denominators. The source of the denomi-\\nnator data should be reported and calculations of estimates be\\ndescribed (e.g. manufacturer data like total doses distributed,\\nreporting through Ministry of Health, coverage/population based\\ndata, etc.).\\n(34) The incidence of cases in the study population should be\\npresented and clearly identiﬁed as such in the text.\\n(35) If the distribution of birth weight data is skewed, median\\nand range are usually the more appropriate statistical\\ndescriptors than a mean. However, the mean and standard\\ndeviation should also be provided.\\n7 An AEFI is deﬁned as serious by international standards if it meets one or more of\\nthe following criteria: (1) it results in death, (2) is life-threatening, (3) it requires\\ninpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization, (4)\\nresults in persistent or signiﬁcant disability/incapacity, (5) is a congenital anomaly/\\nbirth defect, (6) is a medically important event or reaction.\\n8 To determine the appropriate category, the user should ﬁrst establish, whether a\\nreported event meets the criteria for the lowest applicable level of diagnostic\\ncertainty, e.g. Level three. If the lowest applicable level of diagnostic certainty of the\\ndeﬁnition is met, and there is evidence that the criteria of the next higher level of\\ndiagnostic certainty are met, the event should be classiﬁed in the next category. This\\napproach should be continued until the highest level of diagnostic certainty for a\\ngiven event could be determined. Major criteria can be used to satisfy the\\nrequirement of minor criteria. If the lowest level of the case deﬁnition is not met, it\\nshould be ruled out that any of the higher levels of diagnostic certainty are met and\\nthe event should be classiﬁed in additional categories four or ﬁve.\\n9 If the evidence available for an event is insufﬁcient because information is\\nmissing, such an event should be categorized as ‘‘Reported Low birth weight with\\ninsufﬁcient evidence to meet the case deﬁnition”.\\n10 An event does not meet the case deﬁnition if investigation reveals a negative\\nﬁnding of a necessary criterion (necessary condition) for diagnosis.

The keywords were selected by\\nresearching MeSH (PubMed) and DeCS terms (LILACS and\\nSciELO).\\nSelection criteria\\nThe criteria used for study inclusion were: original articles\\nthat\\n established an association between GA, BW , and lan-\\nguage\\n development in Brazilian children; studies published\\nin\\n the last ten years (January/2003 to December/2012)\\nin Portuguese and English, and that used the cohort,\\ncase-control,\\n longitudinal, cross-sectional, descriptive ana-\\nlytical,\\n and retrospective methods.'),\n",

The independent\\nvariables\\n were GA, BW , gender , age at time of evaluation,\\nfamily income, and maternal level of education.\\nFor\\n the purposes of the present study , prematurity was\\nconsidered\\n at three levels: borderline preterm (GA 35-\\n36\\n weeks), moderately preterm (GA 31-34 weeks), and\\nextremely\\n preterm (GA ≤ 30 weeks). Newborns with low BW\\nwere\\n classiﬁed as low BW (< 2,500 g), very low birth weight\\n(<\\n 1,500 g), and extremely low BW (< 1,000 g).11\\nData analysis\\nThe initial search resulted in a total of 57 articles, of which\\n36 were excluded after the title and abstract were read, as\\nthey\\n did not address the subject, were literature reviews, or\\nwere\\n case reports. Of the remaining 21 articles, eight were\\nexcluded due to duplication. The 13 selected articles were\\nread\\n and included in the review . The results of the assessed\\nstudies\\n were analyzed descriptively .\\nResults and discussion\\nThe characteristics of the studies, such as the methodol-\\nogy\\n used, age of the assessed children, and sample size are\\ndescribed\\n in T able 1. Most of the studies assessed children\\nyounger\\n than 2 years and sample size varied. The years 2009\\nand\\n 2012 featured the greatest number of articles published\\non\\n the subject.\\nT able 2 describes the language assessment tools used in\\nthe\\n studies, demonstrating a variety of tests, scales, and\\nlists,\\n among techniques used by the authors.\\nRegarding\\n the locations where studies were conducted,\\neleven\\n were performed in the Southeast Region, whereas\\nthe\\n South and Northeast Regions were represented by one\\nstudy\\n each.2,8,9,12- - -21It was not possible to make comparisons\\nbetween\\n the results obtained in these regions due to the\\ndifference\\n in the number of studies carried out by region,\\nwhich is indicative of the need to perform studies in other\\nBrazilian\\n regions.\\nLanguage\\n skills of premature infants were evaluated in\\ntwo\\n different manners by the studies: those that focused\\non\\n expressive language2,15 and those that addressed both\\nreceptive\\n and expressive language.8,9,12- - -14,16- - -21The two\\nstudies\\n that evaluated expressive language only2,15 found a\\ndelay\\n in language development in preterm children when\\ncompared\\n to children born at term, and one found a signiﬁ-\\ncantly\\n lower difference in the vocabulary in all the semantic\\ncategories.15\\nIn the 11 studies that analyzed the receptive and expres-\\nsive\\n language, four found signiﬁcant differences in both\\ntypes\\n of language,9,12,13,17 three found differences in expres-\\nsive\\n language only ,8,14,19 two did not differentiate the type of\\nlanguage\\n but demonstrated signiﬁcant difference,16,20 and\\ntwo\\n found no difference in any of the language types.18,21\\nAmong those that found signiﬁcant differences in both\\ntypes\\n of language, the difference found in expressive lan-\\nguage\\n was more signiﬁcant when compared to receptive\\nlanguage.12,13,17 In one study that showed a signiﬁcant\\ndifference,8 the most delayed expressive language item in\\npremature infants was ﬁrst word production (p = 0.0096). In\\na\\n study that showed no difference between the full-term and\\npreterm\\n children,18 a possible explanation reported by the\\nauthors\\n was the assistance parents received in the follow-\\nup\\n carried out at the service, which included information on\\nhow to stimulate the child’s language. Therefore, the review\\nsuggests\\n that expressive language was more affected than\\nreceptive\\n language in premature infants.\\nThe language acquisition delay in these children may\\nbe\\n associated with brain injuries related to neona-\\ntal\\n complications,8,22 with central nervous system\\nimmaturity ,8,22,23 and the child’s interaction with the\\nenvironment\\n and with people.24 The maturational processes\\nand\\n the individual’s interactions with the environment are\\ninﬂuenced by organic, psychological, social, and economic\\nconditions\\n that may have a negative or positive impact on\\nchild\\n development.25 Therefore, the interaction between\\nparent\\n and child becomes of utmost importance for child\\ndevelopment,\\n especially\\n in preterm infants. Thus, it is\\nvery\\n important that pediatricians and speech therapists are\\naware\\n of all these aspects when observing the language of\\npremature\\n infants,\\n so that, if necessary , early referrals and\\ninterventions\\n can be performed.\\nIn\\n the\\n six studies that compared language development\\nbetween\\n groups\\n differentiated by GA or BW ,9,13,15- - -17,21it was\\nobserved\\n that children born with lower GA and BW showed\\nthe worst results in language assessments. Most studies that\\nperformed comparisons between groups\\n differentiated by\\nGA found that samples of preterm children had poorer per-\\nformance on language assessment tests when compared to\\nchildren\\n born at term,\\n and the lower GA was associated with\\nchildren’s lower phrasal extent (p = 0.016),15 losses in the\\nexpressive\\n language area at 4-6 months and 10-12 months of\\nage,13 and losses in the expressive language area in children\\naged\\n 12-36 months.21\\nIn the study by Schirmer et al.,9 which used Denver II,\\nBayley\\n II, and the Developmental Sequences of Language\\nBehavior\\n by Nicolosi for evaluation, it was observed that\\nthe\\n mental, psychomotor , and behavioral development in\\nnewborns\\n with BW < 1,500 g showed a statistically signiﬁcant\\nassociation\\n with language development, whereas in infants\\nwith\\n BW > 1,500 g, this association remained signiﬁcant in\\nthe\\n mental aspect.9 Thus, the language development delay\\nmay\\n be associated with delays in other areas of develop-\\nment,\\n especially in infants with lower BW .\\nIn\\n the three studies that compared language assess-\\nment\\n results with BW ,15,17,21 lower BW was associated with\\nthe\\n worse performance in expressive language,21 lower\\nnumber\\n of words (p = 0.045), and lower phrasal extension\\n(p\\n = 0.019).15 When comparing low BW with very-low BW\\npreterm\\n infants at age 12-24 months, infants with very low\\nBW\\n showed higher losses in the assessed areas compared to\\nthose\\n with low weight.17\\nOliveira et al. 8 compared full-term newborns small for\\nGA\\n (FTNB/SGA)\\n with preterm newborns adequate for GA\\n(PTNB/AGA) using the Early Language Milestone (ELM) scale.\\nBoth\\n groups had equivalent linguistic production for chrono-\\nlogical\\n age up to 6 months. This result differs from that\\nfound\\n by Pereira and Funayama,13 who found differences\\nin\\n language between the groups at the ages of 0-3 months,\\neven\\n those with corrected ages.

Therefore, it is dif-\\nﬁcult\\n to compare results in language studies because of the\\ndifferent\\n instruments used for assessment.\\nRegarding\\n the age at which premature infants showed\\na\\n more meaningful language delay , three studies fol-\\nlowed\\n children longitudinally and were able to analyze this\\naspect.8,13,16 Oliveira et al. 8 evaluated the expressive lan-\\nguage\\n in two groups of children, FTNB/SGA and PTNB/AGA,\\nat\\n 6, 9, 12, and 18 months and found that until the 6th\\nmonth, the infants showed a normal performance for their\\nage,\\n and only in the 12th month was there a statistically sig-\\nniﬁcant\\n delay in the FTNB/SGA group, which remained with\\npolysyllabic\\n babbling, and in the PTNB/AGA group, in the\\nproduction of ﬁrst words. Pereira and Funayama13 reviewed\\nchildren’s\\n language at ﬁve different levels: I (0-3 months),\\nII\\n (4-6 months), III (7-9 months), IV (10-12 months), and V\\n(13-15\\n months).\\nAs\\n for receptive language, preterm children had a sig-\\nniﬁcantly\\n worse performance at level I, and in expressive\\nlanguage, performance was worse in levels II and IV . Based\\non\\n these results, children up to 12 months of age were more\\nlikely\\n to have language development delays. Lamônica and\\nPicolini16 observed children’s language in two periods, 6-12\\nmonths\\n and 12-24 months, and although in both periods the\\nresults\\n were signiﬁcantly worse for preterm infants, more\\nchildren\\n had language delay in the period of 6-12 months\\nthan\\n at 12-24 months. Thus, studies have shown an evolu-\\ntion\\n of preterm infants during the ﬁrst two years of life,\\nwith\\n language development drawing nearer to the develop-\\nment\\n of children born at term. This development is known\\nas\\n the ‘‘catch-up phenomenon,’’ which may occur with both\\npreterm\\n and low BW newborns.24\\nAnother aspect discussed in the articles was whether gen-\\nder\\n inﬂuenced language development.8,15,19,20 In the four\\nanalyzed\\n studies, two of them found no statistically signif-\\nicant difference,8,15 whereas the other two indicated that\\nmale gender was a risk factor for alterations in language\\ndevelopment.19,20\\nIn\\n a systematic review of literature carried out in national\\nand\\n international databases between January 2005 and June\\n2010,\\n one of the aspects analyzed in preterm children was\\nlanguage.26 A total of ten articles were associated with lan-\\nguage, and although many did not include Brazilian children,\\na\\n comparison might be relevant. Vieira and Linhares26 identi-\\nﬁed in some\\n studies that male gender was a risk predictor for\\nlanguage delay in premature infants. There is still no consen-\\nsus\\n among the results, but there is an indication that male\\nchildren are at increased risk for the language development\\ndelay .\\nLanguage\\n acquisition and\\n development involve multiple\\naspects, and in addition to the physical and biological fac-\\ntors,\\n it is important to consider social and cultural factors\\nthat\\n involve variables such as the environment where the\\nchild\\n lives, the quality of adult-child interaction,27- - -29and\\nthe\\n degree of parental education and family income. In\\nthis\\n review , one study assessed maternal education and\\nper\\n capita income21 and two analyzed parental education\\nand\\n family income.15,26 In one study , poorer performance in\\nreceptive\\n language was correlated with low maternal edu-\\ncational\\n level.21 In the review by Vieira and Linhares,26 low\\neducational\\n level was considered a risk factor for language\\ndevelopment,\\n whereas higher family income was a protec-\\ntive\\n factor . Isotani et al. 15 found no signiﬁcant differences\\nbetween\\n maternal education and the child’s expressive lan-\\nguage,\\n but when correlating income with child’s phrasal\\nextension,\\n a positive association was observed (p = 0.008),\\nso\\n that the higher the family income, the greater the child’s\\nphrasal\\n extension.\\nChild\\n development, especially that related to language,\\nis\\n greatly inﬂuenced by the social environment in which the\\nchild\\n lives,30,31 and low income and educational level are\\nvariables\\n that may be related to fewer opportunities for\\ninteractions between adult and child, collapse of the fam-\\nily\\n structure, and school abandonment. Therefore, children\\nborn\\n preterm whose families are in vulnerable situations\\nmay\\n be more prone to developmental alterations and, thus,\\nit\\n is extremely important for health professionals to be\\naware\\n of these issues.\\nConclusion\\nWhen associating preterm birth with child language devel-\\nopment,\\n the literature demonstrated that prematurity is a'),\n",
